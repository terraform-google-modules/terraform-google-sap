# terraform-google-sap

The terraform-google-sap repository both copies and points to official [Google SAP Terraform Templates](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/sap/docs/tf-for-sap). As new Terraform templates are released for GCP they will be released in this repository as well. The original modules that were located here all have functionally equivalent modules available.

## Usage
