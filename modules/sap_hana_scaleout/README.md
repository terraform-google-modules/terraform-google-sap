# terraform-google-sap for SAP HANA Scaleout

This template follows the documented steps
https://cloud.google.com/solutions/sap/docs/sap-hana-ha-scaleout-tf-deployment-guide and deploys an SAP HANA scale-out system that includes the SAP HANA host auto-failover fault-recovery solution.

## Usage

Basic usage of this module is as follows:

```hcl
module "hana_scaleout" {
  source  = "terraform-google-modules/sap/google//modules/sap_hana_scaleout"
  version = "~> 1.1"

  project_id          = "PROJECT_ID"          # example: my-project-x
  zone                = "ZONE"                # example: us-east1-b
  machine_type        = "MACHINE_TYPE"        # example: n1-highmem-32
  subnetwork          = "SUBNETWORK"          # example: default
  linux_image         = "LINUX_IMAGE"         # example: rhel-8-4-sap-ha
  linux_image_project = "LINUX_IMAGE_PROJECT" # example: rhel-sap-cloud
  instance_name       = "VM_NAME"             # example: hana-instance
  sap_hana_sid        = "SID"                 # example: ABC, Must conform to [a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9]{2}
  sap_hana_shared_nfs = "HANA_SHARED_NFS"     # example: 10.10.10.10:/shared
  sap_hana_backup_nfs = "HANA_BACKUP_NFS"     # example: 10.10.10.10:/backup
}
```

Functional example is included in the
[examples](../../examples/sap_hana_scaleout) directory.

## Inputs

| Name | Description | Type | Default | Required |
|------|-------------|------|---------|:--------:|
| can\_ip\_forward | Whether sending and receiving of packets with non-matching source or destination IPs is allowed. | `bool` | `true` | no |
| instance\_name | Hostname of the GCE instance. | `string` | n/a | yes |
| linux\_image | Linux image name to use. | `string` | n/a | yes |
| linux\_image\_project | The project which the Linux image belongs to. | `string` | n/a | yes |
| machine\_type | Machine type for the instances. | `string` | n/a | yes |
| network\_tags | OPTIONAL - Network tags can be associated to your instance on deployment. This can be used for firewalling or routing purposes. | `list(string)` | `[]` | no |
| post\_deployment\_script | OPTIONAL - gs:// or https:// location of a script to execute on the created VM's post deployment. | `string` | `""` | no |
| primary\_startup\_url | Startup script to be executed when the VM boots, should not be overridden. | `string` | `"curl -s BUILD.TERRA_SH_URL/sap_hana_scaleout/startup.sh | bash -s BUILD.TERRA_SH_URL"` | no |
| project\_id | Project id where the instances will be created. | `string` | n/a | yes |
| public\_ip | OPTIONAL - Defines whether a public IP address should be added to your VM. By default this is set to Yes. Note that if you set this to No without appropriate network nat and tags in place, there will be no route to the internet and thus the installation will fail. | `bool` | `true` | no |
| reservation\_name | Use a reservation specified by RESERVATION\_NAME.<br>By default ANY\_RESERVATION is used when this variable is empty.<br>In order for a reservation to be used it must be created with the<br>"Select specific reservation" selected (specificReservationRequired set to true)<br>Be sure to create your reservation with the correct Min CPU Platform for the<br>following instance types:<br>n1-highmem-32 : Intel Broadwell<br>n1-highmem-64 : Intel Broadwell<br>n1-highmem-96 : Intel Skylake<br>n1-megamem-96 : Intel Skylake<br>m1-megamem-96 : Intel Skylake<br>All other instance types can have automatic Min CPU Platform" | `string` | `""` | no |
