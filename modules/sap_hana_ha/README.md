# SAP HANA HA Submodule

This module deals with SAP HANA HA configuration and deployment.

## Usage

The resources/services/activations/deletions that this module will create/trigger are:

- Create Primary and Secondary Compute Instance that will host SAP HANA HA.
- Create a Static IP Address for the two Compute Instance's.
- Create 2 Persistent Disks to host SAP HANA HA's File systems on primary and secondary nodes.

You can go in the [examples](../../examples) folder complete working example. However, here's an example of how to use the module in a main.tf file.

## Requirements

Make sure you've gone through the root [Requirement Section](../../README.md#requirements)

### SAP HANA Software
 Follow instructions [here](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/sap/docs/sap-hana-ha-deployment-guide#creating_a_cloud_storage_bucket_for_the_sap_hana_ha_installation_files) to properly Download SAP HANA from the SAP Marketplace, and upload it to a GCS bucket.


### Configure Service Account for identifying the Compute instances
The compute instances created by this submodule will need to download SAP HANA from a GCS bucket in order install it. Follow the instructions below to ensure a successful installation:

 1. [Create a new service account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts)
 2. Grant this new service account the following permissions on the bucket where you uploaded SAP HANA installation file:
    - Stackdriver Metadata writer: `roles/stackdriver.resourceMetadata.writer`
    - Compute Network admin: `roles/compute.networkAdmin`
    - Log writer: `roles/logging.logWriter`
    - Storage viewer: `roles/storage.objectViewer`

  You may use the following gcloud command:

```shell
ROLES=("roles/stackdriver.resourceMetadata.writer", "roles/compute.networkAdmin", "roles/logging.logWriter", "roles/storage.objectViewer")
for ROLE in ${ROLES[*]}; do
  gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding <project-id> \
    --member=serviceAccount:<service-account-email> --role=${ROLE}
done
```

3. When configuring the module, use this newly created service account's email, to set the `service_account_email` input variable.

### Post deployment script
If you need to run a post deployment script, the script needs to be accessible via a **https:// or gs:// URl**.
It is the recommended way is to use a GCS Bucket in the following way.:

1. Upload the to a GCS bucket.
2. Make sure the service account attached to the instance has the following permissions on the bucket:
   - roles/storage.objectViewer
     - Note that this permission should already be granted if the bucket is in the same project as the one where you created the service account previously.

3. Set the post_deployment_script input to the gs:// link to your script. (i.e gs://<bucket_name>/<my_script>)
